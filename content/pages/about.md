    subtitle: Two middle schoolers sharing their adventures with animals
    text: >
      Welcome to our corner of the internet! We're two friends who decided to
      create this site to share pictures and stories about our pets. What 
      started as a simple idea turned into a fun project where we can share our
      love for our furry friends.

      We're both in 7th grade at Northwest School and share a passion for music
      and theatre. When we're not posting about cats, you can find us practicing
      our instruments or rehearsing for the next show with Broadway Bound
      Children's Theatre.

If you've been following Fitz's adventures, you might be wondering about his sister. Let me introduce you to Biana - Fitz's litter-mate and a cat with quite the origin story.

## A Dramatic Beginning

Fitz and Biana weren't born into easy circumstances. Their mom was a pregnant cat found alone in an abandoned apartment. Somehow, she survived in that empty space with nothing but access to water from an open toilet. To this day, no one knows what she found to eat during that time, but she made it through and gave birth to three kittens: Fitz, Biana, and one more sibling.

A friend of ours ended up adopting their mom and the third sibling, so we still get to hear updates about them. It's nice knowing the family stayed somewhat connected, even if separated.

## The Name Game

I named both Fitz and Biana after characters from the Keeper of the Lost Cities books. If you know the series, you know these characters are pretty awesome, and it felt right for these two survivors. Fitz in the books is confident and loyal, while Biana is fierce and underestimated - kind of fitting for our cats, actually.

## Two Very Different Personalities

While Fitz is bold and curious (as you've seen from his bearded dragon friendship), Biana is... let's say more cautious. Where Fitz will march right up to investigate something new, Biana watches from a safe distance first. She's skeptical of changes, wary of strangers, and generally takes her time warming up to new situations.

But once she trusts you? She's just as loving as her brother, maybe even more so because you know you've earned it.

## Sibling Bond

Despite their different approaches to life, Fitz and Biana have a special bond. They'll chase each other around the house, groom each other (when they feel like it), and sometimes curl up together for naps. They communicate in that silent sibling way - a look, a tail flick, and they know what the other is thinking.

It's pretty cool having two cats who grew up together from day one. They have a connection that's different from just being housemates.

## Looking Ahead

Biana might not be as bold as Fitz in her adventures, but she's got her own charm. Stay tuned for more stories about both of them - I have a feeling Biana will surprise us all eventually.

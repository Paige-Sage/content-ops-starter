![Fitz the cat with our bearded dragon](/images/lizardAndCat.jpg)

When we first got our bearded dragon, we weren't sure how Fitz would react. Cats are natural hunters, after all, and a lizard basking under a heat lamp seemed like it might be too tempting. But Fitz has surprised us in the best way possible.

## The First Meeting

The first time Fitz saw the bearded dragon, he approached the tank with his usual curious intensity - ears forward, eyes wide, tail twitching. But instead of going into hunt mode, something different happened. He sat down and just... watched.

## An Unexpected Bond

Now, whenever the bearded dragon is out of the tank (supervised, of course!), Fitz comes over to check things out. He's incredibly gentle, sniffing carefully and keeping his claws retracted. Sometimes the dragon will tell Fitz to back up but other times he'll let Fitz come close and nose bump him - a couple times Fitz has gotten a dragon tongue on his nose and he does not seem to like that!

## The Photo

The photo above captures one of their hangouts perfectly. Fitz has this look of mild confusion but also acceptance, like "Yeah, I guess we're friends now." The bearded dragon is just vibing.

Who knew a cat and a lizard could be buddies? Fitz likes him more than he likes Fitz, but its working. Stay tuned for more adventures!
